# Essential Scala Book code and exercises
I use the book to start learning scala along with other resources.
I made this repo to help me revisit material, code and just play around with it and do some exercises.
One might find this useful as with this repo there is no need to copy and past from the book to own IDE 
and one can focus on material more efficiently.

Essential Scala Book repo with Code from the book for a better understanding and repeat. 
Download book (https://underscore.io/books/essential-scala/)

The idea behind this repo is to give an easier way to check the code in IDE 
to see and play with it that give an easier way to get hands dirty.
Also having the code handy will help you to repeat the content of the book easier to put it 
in your brain easier and more efficient.
I use intellij IDEA for the project as my main IDE and recommend you to try a free version of it if you do not use it. 

### How I used the book and the repo.

1 - I scanned the book to get the frame and context of it. 
    Just checked what the book is about and read some of the content from each cahpters

2 - I read it but without paying too much attention - to get 
    general idea and start getting into SCALA and grasp general context of it

3 - At work we had a learning club that we cover a half of each chapter every two weeks. 
    This helped me to get back to the book content, 
    read it over again and do exercises to get prepared to each new learning group session. 
    This time I use all my attention and really learned the chapter also using few other resources and exersises.
    On learning group there were some great discussions and question to uncover parts that were not very clear.

4 - Made this repo to re-visit book content and pay with code in more organized way that might help someone else
