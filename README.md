# Essential Scala Book code and exercises
Essential Scala Book repo with Code from the book for a better understanding and repeat. 
Download book (https://underscore.io/books/essential-scala/)
Here you also could find a code for exercises to help you do the tasks yourself.

The idea behind this repo is to give an easier way to check the code in IDE 
to see and play with it that gve a easier way to get hand dirty.
Also having the code handy will help you to repeat the content of the book easier to put it 
in your brain easier and more efficient.
I use intellij IDEA for the project as my main IDE and recommend you to try a free version of it if you do not use it.
