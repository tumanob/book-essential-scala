/**
 * 7 Type Classes
 *
 * Type classes are a powerful feature of Scala that allow us to extend existing
 * libraries with new functionality,
 * without using inheritance and without having access to the original library source code.
 *
 * "We also wanted to have the other attributes of functional programming, such as
 * types, generics, pattern matching.
 * And we wanted to integrate the functional and object-oriented parts in a cleaner
 * way than what we were able to achieve before with the Pizza language.
 * That was something we deeply cared about from the start." - Martin Odersky
 * https://www.artima.com/articles/the-goals-of-scalas-design
 *
 * A type class is like a trait, defining an interface. However, with type classes we can:
    --> plug in different implementations of an interface for a given class; and
    --> implement an interface without modifying existing code.

 This means we can add new methods or new data without changing any existing code.
